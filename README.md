# Shopping Cart - UmaÄ« Japanese Restaurant

## Project's Scope


- See the full live preview on the Netlify Hosting [Umai Restaurant](https://umai-restaurant.netlify.app/).



## Project Details & Description

- Upon further reviewing, I added: **better content and page spacing**, **active anchor links styling**, **better mobile nav sidebar handling(it now closes when it has to)**
- Mobile Responsiveness was created with plain CSS3, for a better understanding of the responsiveness concept and media queries, and then I switched to TailwindCSS.
- This is a SPA (Single Page Application) of a fictive Japanese Restaurant made with React and React Router.
- In this restaurant, we have a landing page, a contact page(for booking a dinner), the menu with items (filtered by food type).
- In the Navigation Bar you can see how many items are in the bag.
- On the Shopping Cart page, you can modify your order (add one, remove one, add custom quantity) and see all the costs.
- Pressing minus until 0 will automatically remove the meal from your order.
